# Dimensionality-Reduction
The following code is the implementation of the algorithm for Euclidean dimesnionality reduction of general metric spaces that was proposed in our paper "Dimensionality Reduction: Theoretical Perspective On Practical Measures". The code is in python using the convex approximation package cvxpy.
